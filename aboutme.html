            Olar! I’m a UX/UI Designer with an <span class="highlight">empathic and pragmatic approach to design</span>. My curiosity about the development process of digital products brought me to Lisbon to start a postgrad in Digital Experience Design and explore the UX universe ✧.
        </p>
        <p>
            What interests me the most in UX design is being all about the ride! Getting to learn more about people and how to <span class="highlight">translate all findings into friendly and fun experiences</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
            I look forward to collaborating on more projects focusing on user research and learning different methods that can help achieve user-centred solutions.
