        <p>Website (2021)</p>
        <p>Duration: 1 month / Designed with Figma</p>
        <p>*Academic project created in collaboration with Cátia Neto, Gonçalo Pascoa and Teresa Fernandes (2021).</p>

    <h3>Problem</h3>
    
    <p>Looking at the job landscape in digital design, it can be confusing. The number of different titles, skills and responsibilities, often overlapping, can leave you wondering “Where exactly do I fit in?”</p>
    <br>
    <p>While we will not attempt to completely solve this issue, we thought that maybe we could help with the resulting identity crisis in a fun way.</p>

    <h3>Process</h3>

    <figure>
        <img src="/assets/img/job-process.jpg" alt="four circles representing each stage of the research.">
        <figcaption>Fig. #1 - Process in four stages based on the double diamond model.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <h3>Discover</h3>
    <h4>First Research</h4>
    <p>We started by searching for jobs opportunities to learn what titles and skills associated were out there.</p>
    <figure>
        <img src="/assets/img/job-discover.jpg" alt="diagram with all stages of the product creationg process and which ones each type of designer works on.">
        <figcaption>Fig. #2 - First analysis.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>We came to the conclusion that it is a complex landscape. So early on we thought of defining major areas against which we could analyse traits and skills. We came up with these five areas.</p>

    <figure>
        <img src="/assets/img/job-groups.jpg" alt="five sticky notes with different colours for each design area and below each a sticky note listing all professionals of that field.">
        <figcaption>Fig. #3 - Our five main design areas.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <h4>Benchmark</h4>
    <p>We looked at different types questionnaires, focusing on personality traits or preferences.</p>
    <figure>
        <img src="/assets/img/job-benchmark.jpg" alt="screenshots of personality quizzes.">
        <figcaption>Fig. #4 - Benchmark research on personality quizzes.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <h4>Who is This For?</h4>
    <p>There are many possibilities of specific targets, yet we wanted to do something simple which could be entertaining for a wider audience.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The primary target are younger professionals who are still a bit unfamiliar with job roles and responsibilities.</p>
    <br>
    <p>But this could also be a fun experience to a more senior professional transitioning from another area (e.g.: graphic designer going into digital design).</p>
    <br>
    <p>Overall we wanted to create an entertaining moment which would in turn have some level of practical use.</p>

    <h3>Define</h3>
    <p>Looking at all the benchmark and research, we made the choice to go with a lighter approach for this project. Using the logic of personality traits and skills to help the user figure out who they are, and where they best fit.</p>
    <br>
    <p>But we wanted to try something different.</p>
    <figure>
        <img src="/assets/img/job-define.jpg" alt="screenshot of a 'meet the team' section, showcasing different photographies with various objects of each member.">
        <figcaption>Fig. #5 - Meet Our Team section from Sub Rosa: Personality through objects.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>How might we get insight into someone’s traits, skills, and preferences without asking questions?</p>

    <h3>Develop</h3>
    <h4>Insight</h4>
    <p>Instead of asking questions, we'll use everyday objects or tools to give us insight into the user's traits and skills. We’re creating a sort of visual quiz.</p>
    <br>
    <p>For e.g., a wacom pen tablet would most likely be used by a UI designer, while a special keyboard would most likely be used by a programmer.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Next, we selected different objects and the areas to which they match.</p>
    <figure>
        <img src="/assets/img/job-divide.jpg" alt="multiple sitcky notes divided into five categories, having one colour for each.">
        <figcaption>Fig. #6 - We collectively selected which objects would represent each area by voting with colourful dots.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Depending on the number of objects of each area selected, the user would get a percentage which then would inform the area with highest score, give a brief description of traits and responsibilities to look for in a job, while also suggesting the most likely fit in terms of job title.</p>
    <br>
    <p>At this stage we also defined a set of job title results the platform would deliver.</p>

    <h4>Prioritising</h4>
    <p>There were many ideias on the table, so we used the MoSCoW method to narrow down what we were actually going to do for this project. Out of all our ideas, which ones we would go with at this stage.</p>
    <figure>
        <img src="/assets/img/job-priority.jpg" alt="sticky notes with ideas divided in: must have, should have, could have and will not have">
        <figcaption>Fig. #7 - MoSCow helped us focus on what we should focus on this first phase.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>The “must have” for the project was to have a questionnaire that would result in a profile that would in turn match to job titles.</p>
    <br>
    <p>This result includes a brief description and a percentage for each of the five areas we defined. Then the platform suggests the best match in terms of job title with a description of skills and responsibilities.</p>

    <h4>Wireframes</h4>
    <p>Once we had are priorities clear we moved on to testing what the platform might be organised.</p>
    <figure>
        <img src="/assets/img/job-wireframes.jpg" alt="six wireframes organised in two columns.">
        <figcaption>Fig. #8 - Wireframes.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>As a "should have", we proposed that this platform have a simple job board integrated, thus giving it a more practical function, adding value to the experience.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The job board is merely a repository of posting that link to the job details page in their original website.</p>

    <h4>Moodboard</h4>
    <figure>
        <img src="/assets/img/job-moodboard.jpg" alt="different images aligned in rows with geometric and bright colours.">
        <figcaption>Fig. #9 - After sketching and defining what goes where, we looked at some visuals for inspiration.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <h4>Tone of voice</h4>
    <p>The platform will be talking to the user in a shrink-like manner, asking the user to choose then slighting giving hints such as:</p>
    <figure>
        <img src="/assets/img/job-tone.jpg" alt="four example phrases of the tone of voice">
        <figcaption>Fig. #10 - “you left the cup of coffee behind, interesting.”</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <h3>Solution</h3>
    <h4>Welcome Page</h4>
    <p>This is the welcoming screen where we have a brief disclosure of what this is.</p>
    <figure>
        <img src="/assets/img/job-screen1.jpg" alt="welcome page asking for the user's name and next, explaining the quizz.">
        <figcaption>Fig. #11 - Welcome Page.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>We want to make the experience more approachable, so we ask the usar to tell us their name before starting.</p>
    <br>
    <p>In the next screen we introduce the mechanics of the experience.</p>

    <h4>The Quizz</h4>
    <p>Here we see the first screen of the quiz, where the user is invited to choose objects they’d keep on their desk.</p>
    <br>
    <p>For the interaction with the platform, we wanted to use drag and drop when the user chose the objects.</p>
    <figure>
        <img src="/assets/img/job-screen2.jpg" alt="two screens overlapping. on top has one of the phases with different objects for the user to pick, the second is a comment page telling the user to move on to the next scene.">
        <figcaption>Fig. #12 - “Set your desk" phase.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>They’d have to pick it up and drop it in the selection bar at the bottom of the screen.</p>
    <br>
    <p>When they're done, they move on to the next screen where the platform will give a commentary on the choices.</p>

    <h4>Phases</h4>
    <p>To keep the experience short and avoid abandonments, we organised it into three moments: physical space, digital tools, and break time. In each round the user will choose objects that better suit them in a total of 10 choices across all three rounds.</p>
    <figure>
        <img src="/assets/img/job-screen3.jpg" alt="three screens showing each phase of the quizz, with their respective icons on top of each screen.">
        <figcaption>Fig. #13 - Each phase of the quizz is set on a different work scene. Coffee anyone?</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>After filling all the slots, the user will get their results.</p>
    <figure>
        <img src="/assets/img/job-screen4.jpg" alt="two screens side by side. on the left shows the end of the quizz and the second is the top of the results page.">
        <figcaption>Fig. #14 - The quizz result is represented in percentages for each design area.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <h4>Results Page</h4>
    <p>Here we see the results page with all the features we wanted to include:</p>
    <br>
    <ul class="body-list">
        <li>→ brief description</li>
        <li>→ percentage breakdown</li>
        <li>→ top job title match</li>
        <li>→ information on skills and responsibilities of this job</li>
        <li>→ a couple of other job title options</li>
        <li>→ a few job opportunities that best match the results</li>
    </ul>
    <figure>
        <img src="/assets/img/job-screen5.jpg" alt="Two screens showing the top and bottom part of the results page.">
        <figcaption>Fig. #15 - Results Page.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>The user can also share their results on social media or they can retake the quiz.</p>

    <h3>To Be Continued</h3>
    <h4>Should have, could have</h4>
    <p>Some of the ideias for this platform didn’t make the cut for this stage. Here we leave those that would be good add-ons if we were to continue developing the project. ✧</p>
