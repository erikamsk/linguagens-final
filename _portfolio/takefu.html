    <h3>The Brief</h3>
    <p>Create a design kit following specific directions (for e.g. number of topography styles, colour variations and so on) and three interfaces (homepage, product details’ and check-out pages) for an online shop, with a product of our choosing.</p>

    <h3>Product</h3>
    <p>The product chosen for the project was a Japanese Kitchen Knife by Takefu Knife Village, a cooperative of 13 knife companies that work and produce in the same space, sharing equipment and launching their own creations but also collaborations. The concept of competitors collaborating with each other is admirable in itself, but the highlight comes from their knives, which have been produced there since the 14th century.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Visiting the website of Takefu Knife Village (which has only some parts translated to English) and some of its competitors, and taking into account its worldwide fame and cultural differences, it was set that the purpose of the interface to be created would be present the Japanese knife to the western audience, following its standards to bring familiarity, but referencing the Japanese origin in its visual elements, and highlighting the tradition and quality of production as the main differential.</p>
        

    <h3>Research</h3>
    <p>The discovery phase began with a desk research on the history and tradition of knife production in Japan and its process, as well as the characteristics of Japanese design. A benchmark was also carried out on e-commerce sites of Japanese knives.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Among the most interesting information found, it can be highlighted:</p>
    <br>
    <p><i>→ The main characteristics that differentiate Japanese knives from Western knives are the shape of their blade (more details at the front), their rigidity (Japanese knives are harder) and the way in which they are attached to the handle;</i></p>
    <br>
    <p><i>→ How Japanese philosophy influences your design. Japanese minimalism is intuitive, asymmetrical, warm and fluid and is visually translated into a clean, simple aesthetic without being sterile. These same characteristics are also related to the design of a good interface;</i></p>
    <br>
    <p><i>→ The influence of the introduction of computers and the advancement of this technology in the 20th century on Japanese design, moving to a less “crafty” feel, taking a cleaner approach with defined lines and solid colours (Figure 1).</i></p>

    </figure>

    <p>This first research helped to define some important aspects to be followed in the design system and in the creation of interfaces, as the choice of a minimalist look, use of thin lines and straight edges, making a connection to the sharp and precise cutting of the knives, and the use of a grid in blocks to reference the material and “raw” aspect of the production process.</p>

    <h3>Design System</h3>
    <h4>Colours</h4>
    <p>The palette was created from colours taken from the Japanese Government's “Traditional Craftsmanship Certification Seal” (Figure 2), which is composed of black, red and gold. All colours and their variations have minimum AA contrast, even at small text sizes.</p>

        <figcaption>Fig #2 - “Traditional Craftsmanship Certification Seal” by the Japanese Government.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>→ Primary Color: A non-total black (representing iron) was defined as the primary colour, as it is the strongest.</p>
    <br>
    <p>→ Secondary Color: It was the last colour to be defined: a beige inspired by the gold of the seal, but with a higher percentage of red to obtain a more harmonious palette. Referring to natural materials and handcraft, this colour brings the Japanese look without being obvious.</p>
    <br>
    <p>→ Accent Color: The red, coming from the Japanese flag, also refers to the fire used to forge the knives. It was initially thought to be used as secondary, but due to the contrast and its already common use for alerts, it turned out to be the highlight color.</p>
    <br>
    <p>→ Neutral Color: White was chosen as the neutral color, as it is used on the Japanese flag “background”.</p>

    <h4>Typography</h4>
    <p>The font used for the project is Noto Sans Japanese, a “global” font that had the Latin alphabet and the three Japanese alphabets, all featuring a complete family of weights.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The hierarchy of the typographic styles was created with two scales starting from two base sizes: 16px and 20px, the first being for body text of the Latin alphabet, and the second for the Japanese alphabet, which with its more detailed characters needs a larger size for better readability.</p>

    <figure>

        <figcaption>Fig #4 - The Typographic Styles were created with two scales.</figcaption>
    </figure>
        
    <h4>Buttons & Forms</h4>
    <p>Buttons and forms have hard edges with no curvature and strong line presence (eg secondary is edged and tertiary is “underlined”) to reference the knife's sharp, precise cut. To follow the minimalist line, they only use two colours (primary and neutral) and present subtle changes in their states.</p>

    <h3>Designing the Interface</h3>
    <p>While reading about Japanese knives, it was discovered that one of the characteristics that differentiate them from western knives is the point. Knives produced in the West have a blade with symmetrical tip (Figure 6). The Japanese have blades with a single bevel, being angled only on one side, which means that right-handed and left-handed people have to use the knife with the respective angle, for example. But there is a third type, the Western-style Japanese blades, in which the knife is beveled on both sides but asymmetrically. This concept proved to be interesting for the project because it brought the Japanese interpretation to the western style, which is the proposal of this project.</p>

    </figure>

    <p>The blocks follow a base composed of three parts of different proportions (three, five and four columns), which can be merged, allowing greater flexibility in the layout and also maintaining consistency on all pages.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Using the Moodboard created with images collected during the discovery phase, medium fidelity wireframes were made on Figma (Figure 6). The main objective was to test the three-block layout.</p>

        <figcaption>Fig. #7 - First wireframe for the product's detail page.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>The grid with three blocks proved to be functional, and had only a few adjustments during tests with wireframes in proportion to the sizes of the parts and the order of arrangement. It was decided to keep the first block smaller as it is the place where most titles would be positioned, thus reducing the distance with the body texts on the next block.  ✧</p>
