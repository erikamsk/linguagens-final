        <p>Website (2021)</p>
        <p>Duration: 2 months / Designed with Figma</p>
        <p>*Academic project created in collaboration with Cátia Neto, Júlia Rouxinol, Telmo Julião e Raul Ramos Pinto.</p>

    <h2>Redesigning an University Website</h2>
    <p>University websites can sometimes be overwhelming due to the amount of content and different users they need to address.</p>
    <p>For this project, our object of study was the website of the Faculty of Fine Arts, ULisboa. We were asked to rethink and redesign this website but with a specific target in mind: alumni.</p>
      
    <h2>Our Target</h2>
    <h3>Alumni</h3>
    <p><i>plural noun   /əˈlʌmˌnɑɪ/</i></p>
    <p>Men and women who have completed their studies, esp. at a college or university.</p>

    <h2>The Process Model</h2>

        <figcaption>Fig. #1 - Process in four stages based on the double diamond model.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <h2>Discover</h2>
    <h3>Primary Research - Who is the Target?</h3>
    <p>We elaborated a quick survey to understand how former students use (or not) the website of their former institutions. From that survey we talked to a few people in informal interviews to get a more in-depth notion of their activities and needs.</p>

    <figure>
        <img src="/{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/fbaul-survey.jpg" alt="graphs with results from survey. 45.2% of participants rarely visit the website, and when they do their main reason is to check information on courses (51.8%) and events (42.9%).">
        <figcaption>Fig. #2 - Results from survey made with FBAUL's alumni.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>Participants see as main benefits of an Alumni Portal networking, mentoring, job opportunities annd inspiration and professional update.
        
    <h3>Contextual Analysis - How is the current website?</h3>
    <p>Searching for the topic “alumni”, we get no content dedicated to this particular target, except some news regarding scholarships. So basically the website doesn’t have an alumni area.</p>
        
    <figure>
        <img src="/{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/fbaul-currentwebsite.jpg" alt="screenshot of search's results page for the term 'alumni'on FBAUL's website.">
        <figcaption>Fig. #3 - Results page for the term "alumni" on FBAUL's current website.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>We also analysed the website's data from Google Analytics and one of the most revelant findings was that most visits are made on desktop (60,9%), followed by mobile (37%) and tablets (2,2%). Therefore, for this project we decided to focus and work on the desktop version.</p>
        
    <h3>Secondary Research - What are other universities doing?</h3>
    <p>The strongest examples have a dedicated area for alumni with specific content. Some have a website that exists outside the main university website.</p>
    <p>Most common features include:</p>
    <ul class="body-list">
        <li>→ Events</li>
        <li>→ Job offers</li>
        <li>→ Internships</li>
        <li>→ Education</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Define</h2>
    <h3>Our Personas</h3>

        </figure>
    </div>

    <h3>How Might We?</h3>
    <p>Starting from the three personas that we identified, we defined specific HMWs for each segment. The main objective, given that the current website does not have content directed at alumni, was to create a community.</p>

    <figure>
        <img src="/{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/fbaul-hmw.jpg" alt="How Might We questions in sticky notes for each persona">
        <figcaption>Fig. #7 - How Might We questions for our personas helped define our objectives for the website.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <h3>Prioritization Matrix</h3>
    <p>Using the HMWs, we did a brainstorming session in which the objective was to have several ideas. After clustering similar ideas and discarding others, we used an effort vs. impact matrix to prioritize features.</p>
    <p>Some of these features are:</p>
    <ul class="body-list">
        <li>→ a community</li>
        <li>→ news and events</li>
        <li>→ certificates request</li>
        <li>→ networking </li>
        <li>→ job opportunities</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Ideation</h2>
    <h3>Some Decision-making Needed</h3>
    <p>Our briefing asked for a redesign of the belas-artes website, but given how specific our target is, and considering our research, we had to state some aspects:</p>
    <p><i>→ our target is very specific and requires specific content which is not the main priority of a faculty website;</i></p>
    <p><i>→ they are not the main users of a faculty website;</i></p>
    <p><i>→ at this point, there is no content directed at them in the website.</i></p>
    <p>Concluding, we’d have to create a community and maintain it with relevant content at hand.</p>
    <p>Given all the above, we decided to invest our efforts in creating a platform solely dedicated to the alumni community, which could be accessed through the main faculty website.</p>

    <h3>Information Architecture</h3>
    <figure>
        <img src="/{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/fbaul-architeture.png" alt="diagram with all portal pages separate in main sections">
        <figcaption>Fig. #8 - The alumni portal's structure.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <h3>Functional Benchmark</h3>
    <figure>
        <img src="/{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/fbaul-functional.jpg" alt="screenshots of similar websites with sticky notes with ideas and comments.">
        <figcaption>Fig. #9 - The second benchmark helped us to collect references for our features.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>After defining our goals and features for the project, we needed to understand how we could  materialize these features. For that we did a functional benchmark.</p>

    <h3>Wireframes</h3>
    <figure>
        <img src="/{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/fbaul-wireframe1.jpg" alt="two wireframes screens">
        <figcaption>Fig. #10 - The initial wireframes were very distinctive.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>In the wireframing phase we developed several screens to what could be the alumni portal, keeping in mind that our target needed a distinctive platform from the actual belas-artes website.</p>

    <figure>
        <img src="/{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/fbaul-wireframe2.jpg" alt="two wireframes with the layout we would follow for the final screens".>
        <figcaption>Fig. #11 - Wireframes that were used as a base the final layout.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>However, during this development we wanted to keep a balance and ended up in designing the pages with a clear connection to the current institution’s site but with a fresh layout.</p>

    <h3>Design Branding</h3>
    <p>Given that fbaul has a strict branding manual and displays clear rules to create child brands of the main logo, we developed the b-a alumni brand following those guidelines.</p>

    <figure>
        <img src="/{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/fbaul-branding.jpg" alt="fbaul alumni portal branding elements: logo, colours and typography.">
        <figcaption>Fig. #12 - The FBAUL's alumni portal branding elements.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>We also used the belas-artes brand typography (Circular std) and colors while creating a complementary palette for the alumni portal.</p>

    <h3>Design Kit</h3>
    <p>In order to better work in group simultaneosuly, we defined text, color and effect styles.We also created base components that allowed us to develop all the pages maitaining coherence across the website.</p>

    <figure>
        <img src="/{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/fbaul-kit.jpg" alt="components of our design kit: buttons, icons and typography styles.">
